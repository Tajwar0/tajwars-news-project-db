# The idea
We would like to create an API which allows us to access the data through queries. The plan is to make a backend database like news websites and forums such as the BBC and Reddit respectively. This project will create the necessary endpoints utilizing PostgreSQL which a front-end project can utilize.

# Setting up:
You will need to create two text files '.env.development' and '.env.test', each file will need to contain the text 'PGDATABASE=nc_news' and 'PGDATABASE=nc_news_test' respectively, or whatever names you decide! It is imperative that you add these files to .gitignore before pushing to github.
